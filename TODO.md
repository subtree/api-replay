# TODO: api-replay Implementation

This document outlines all steps needed to implement the api-replay library according to the specification in README.md.

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**✅ COMPLETED (99% of core functionality):**
- ✅ Complete core implementation (types, matcher, recorder, replayer, main API, utils)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (60 tests, 100% line coverage, 94.02% function coverage)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Project setup and configuration

**🎯 NEXT UNFINISHED TASK:**
**Test local installation** - Final step before v1.0.0 release.

**📦 REMAINING FOR v1.0.0 RELEASE:**
1. ✅ JSDoc comments for public APIs
2. ✅ CHANGELOG.md creation
3. ✅ README.md enhancements
4. Local installation testing
