# AI History Log

This file tracks all commands and requests made to Claude Code for the api-replay project.

## 2025-07-17

### Command 1: Initial project analysis and CLAUDE.md creation
**User request:**
```
Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.
            
What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand

[Additional usage notes about CLAUDE.md requirements...]
```

**Action taken:** Analyzed the codebase structure, read README.md, and created CLAUDE.md with project overview, development commands, architecture details, and implementation notes.

### Command 2: Create AI history log
**User request:**
```
I want you to keep a detailed log over every command I give in a file called ai-history.md. ALWAYS record my messages (this would be the first entry) into this file to allow me to track what I've asked you to do for me.
```

**Action taken:** Created ai-history.md file with both previous and current commands logged.

---

### Command 3: Set up conventional commits staging
**User request:**
```
Using conventional commits, stage a commit after each processed user command. Don't actually commit or push.
```

**Action taken:** Set up process to stage changes using git add after each command. Will use conventional commit format but not actually commit or push.

---

### Command 4: Create detailed TODO.md
**User request:**
```
Create a detailed TODO.md detailing all the steps needed to implement this library according to the specification. Bring as much detail to the TODO as needed to guide future implementation.
```

**Action taken:** Created comprehensive TODO.md file with detailed implementation steps covering:
- Project setup (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Core implementation (types, matcher, recorder, replayer, main API)
- Testing strategy with specific test cases
- Publishing preparation
- Optional future enhancements

---

### Command 5: Update TODO with replay verification mechanism
**User request:**
```
The tests should have some way of knowing if the response was a replay or *real* request in order to be sure the code works. Note that I expect apirecordings to be checked into version control, since they are used for testing, also in CI/CD.
```

**Action taken:** Updated TODO.md to:
- Add `wasReplayed` tracking and `getMode()` method to the API
- Make `done()` return replay status information
- Update test examples to verify replay vs record mode
- Remove apirecordings from .gitignore (recordings should be committed)
- Add test utilities for asserting replay status
- Note throughout that recordings are meant for version control
